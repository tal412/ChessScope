- **Opening Database Integration**: Full ECO code support with 500,000+ positions
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Filter by game count, win rate, depth, or time control
- **Smooth Navigation**: Zoom, pan, and explore with fluid animations

### 6. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
- **White vs Black Views**: Switch between your perspective as White or Black
- **Contextual Analysis**: Different strategies and patterns for each color
